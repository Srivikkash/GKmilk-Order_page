I had created a ordering page for a private shop.

I used php,html,css,mysql as my required langauges in this project.

I had used xampp server for my php web host and sql local data base

I created a database named " orderlist "
It as two tables:
  *orders*
  *users_login*

In those database i had

  *registration.html* ->new registration
  
  *dbmanager.php*     ->new users db management
